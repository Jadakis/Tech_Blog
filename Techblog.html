	<h2>Humans Not Need Apply</h2>
	<h3>by Ali Ghaly</h3>
	<img src="https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1579523/will-robots-take-over-our-jobs.jpg?w=736&e=a228b9dac550dbc786e18d1ba57f0148">
	<p>In Humans Not Need Apply, it explains how the wonders of new technology can affect human society since new tech is already doing more progress then the average human based on its economic field. This progress has not affected all jobs. The jobs that I'm about to list are the ones that required minium human labor: Transportation, retail salespersons, First line supervisors, Cashiers, Secretaries, Managers (all other), Sales representatives, Registered nurses, Elmentary school teachers, Janitors/cleaners, programmers. All of these will be gone since technology can teach itself on doing things without internvention. We are not prepared for all this change and we do not know if there will be new jobs that required human labor. Will we become the horse?   </p>
	<p>Based on this information that I wrote for the blog, all of this is true since we made huge advancements on making technology to be cheapier and safier than the average human. Some opposed this claim since many believed that there will be more jobs from the new tech. This is not true since the new technology is already taking up the physical labor. </p>

			<p>  I agree with your opinion. I also believe that technology is taking over and its only a matter of time until we're surrounded by robots. </p>

	<h2>Blown To Bits</h2>

	<p>In Knowing Where You Are, it explains the functions of how the Global Position System (GPS) works towards a  satellite- ranged object, like a cellphone or a rental car with a radio transmitter. The interest details that we're gonna focus on is how  the GPS can calculate its own location from the 24 satellites floating around in space. One example that I can give you is Ron Lee's story, He rented a car from Payless in San Francisco. He headed east to Las Vegas, then back to Los Angeles, and finally home. He expected to pay $150 for his vacation, but the company made him to pay more - $1,400, to precise. The rental contract covered unlimited mileage, but the fine print stated "Don't leave California." The print also stated that they will charge Mr. Lee $1 per Nevada mile.</p>

	<p>In Smile While We Snap, it explains how your camera's functions work and what secrets it holds. The interesting details that were focusing is what does a digital exposure do to affect the person. One example that the reading gives is a harry potter fan. This fan got a prerelease copy, photographed every page, and posted the entire book online before the official release. This lead to a  blatant copyright violation since his digital fingerprints were all over the images  and the camera's encode metadata known as the Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF), includes camera settings (shutter speed, aperture, compression, make, model, orientation), date and time led right to him.</p>

	<p>In Knowing Even Where Your Shoes Are, it explains how the functions of an Radio Frequency Identification tagâ€”RFID works on transferring data to tracking to control access of a plant. The interesting details that we are gonna focus on is how does the RFID tag knows who you are and where you live. One example that I can give you is buying a pair of red shoes at a chain store in New York City, and the shoes have an embedded RFID.  If you pay with a credit card, the store knows your name, and a good deal more about you from your purchasing history. And if you came into a branch store in Los Angeles a month later, and that branch has an RFID reader under the rug at the entrance, the clerk could greet you by name. The clerk might offer an item that will match with your shoes. Or they might know that you have a habit of returning of what you bought. </p>

	<p>Based on what I wrote for my blog, I feel that all of this true since humankind have always been curious from the start and they always test their machines if it can be used for good or bad towards of society.</p>

	<p> In this internview that you're about to read, I asked my advisor Drew on what he thinks about technology.</p>
</body>
	<p>Ali: How Old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
	<p>Drew: The only computer that I had to use when I was 13 years old was the family computer.</p>
	<p>Ali: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>
	<p>Drew: My favorite piece of technology when I was growing up was the Sony walkman since it played my audio tapes.</p>
	<p>Ali: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
	<p>Drew: It left me with mixed emotions since it made my life convenient, but also stressful.</p>
	<p>Ali: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
	<p>Drew: The changes that I've seen over my lifetime mostly helped society since we have finding new medical treatments to cure diseases that were uncurable.</p>
	<p>Ali: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
	<p>Drew: My greatest hope for technology in the future is space exploration.</p>
	<p>Ali: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</p>
	<p>Drew: My greatest fear for technology in the future is artificial intelligence and humans dependancy towards technology.</p>
	<p>Ali: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</p>
	<p>Drew: My advice that I would give towards the younger generation is try to not connected all the time. Have some balance in your life and use your brain. Be communitive with people without your phone.</p>
	<p>Ali: Once we made space exploration, Do you believed that we'll run into contact with other beings?</p>
	<p>Drew: I think we will make contact with other species once we made space exploration.</p>
	<p>Ali: Do you believed that robots will take control over humans?</p>
	<p>Drew: I don't know if robots will take control over humans, but A.I will become a problem.</p>

			<h3> Your interview became a debate.</h3>
			<h4> Brendan DePuy</h4>
			<p>  You did a well peaceful interview. I agree with what Drew said how technology can take students away from the real world.  Check your spelling. </p>
